## Note From the Author
This is a program designed to aid in the playing of the game Blood on the Clocktower, this is an unofficial project and is not asociated at all with the real authors of the game.

NEVER use this program with the consent of the storyteller. The fun of Blood on the Clocktower comes from figuring things out yourself and this program should not detract from it. For that reason it is best if this program is used privately rather than colaberatively as that way it preserves the "circles of knowledge" that people have in the game.

This program neither glitch free, nor is it omniscient, take everything it says to you with a pinch of salt. It also cannot account for human error and makes some assumptions which are not always true.

Remember to have fun.
